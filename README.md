# ImageRecognition
A small image recognition project I had made for Smart India Hackathon selections.

It detects the face of the user and compares it to the dataset of images of celebrities and shows the name of the celebrity with nearest accuracy.
It also detects whether the eyes are open or not, and whether the user's lips are smiling or not.

Feel free to try it out! Cheers!
