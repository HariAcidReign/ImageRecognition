# ImageRecognition
A small image recognition project I had made for Smart India Hackathon selections.

It detects the face of the user and compares it to already saved images of people, and shows the name of the person it relates to with most accuracy. It creates an yellow box around the face, and prints the name near it.

It also detects whether the eyes are open or not, and whether the user's lips are smiling or not.

Feel free to try it out! Cheers!
